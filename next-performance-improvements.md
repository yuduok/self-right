# Next.js Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Self-Right application using Next.js 14 features.

## Configuration Improvements

### Next.js Configuration

```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  // Enable React Strict Mode for better development experience
  reactStrictMode: true,
  
  // Optimize package imports to reduce bundle size
  experimental: {
    // Only import used modules from these packages
    optimizePackageImports: ['antd', 'lucide-react'],
    
    // Enable script workers for better performance
    nextScriptWorkers: true,
  },
  
  // Image optimization configuration
  images: {
    // Set minimum cache TTL for optimized images (in seconds)
    minimumCacheTTL: 60,
  },
  
  // HTTP Agent options for better network performance
  httpAgentOptions: {
    keepAlive: true,
  },
  
  // Compress responses for better network performance
  compress: true,
  
  // Optimize production builds
  swcMinify: true,
};
```

## Server Components

The application now uses Server Components by default, which offer several performance benefits:

1. **Reduced JavaScript Bundle Size**: Server Components are rendered on the server and don't increase the client-side JavaScript bundle.
2. **Faster Initial Page Load**: Content is rendered on the server and sent as HTML, resulting in faster First Contentful Paint (FCP).
3. **Improved SEO**: Search engines can better index content that's rendered on the server.

## Font Optimization

```javascript
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';

// Optimize font loading with proper subset
const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ['latin'],
  display: 'swap',
  variable: '--font-inter',
});
```

This implementation:
- Uses the next/font system to automatically optimize font loading
- Specifies only the needed character subset to reduce file size
- Uses 'swap' display strategy to prevent font blocking
- Creates a CSS variable for consistent usage throughout the app

## Data Fetching Optimization

### Request Memoization

```javascript
import { cache } from 'react';
import 'server-only';

export const fetchWithCache = cache(async (url, options = {}) => {
  // Implementation details
});
```

Benefits:
- Automatically deduplicates identical data requests
- Prevents redundant network requests
- Shares data between components

### Preloading Pattern

```javascript
export const preload = (url, options) => {
  void fetchWithCache(url, options);
};
```

This pattern allows starting data fetching early, even before a component renders, reducing perceived loading time.

## Middleware Optimizations

The middleware now includes:

1. **Static Asset Caching**: Sets appropriate cache headers for static assets
2. **Security Headers**: Adds security headers to improve security and performance
3. **Optimized Authentication Checks**: More efficient routing for authenticated and unauthenticated users

## Route Optimization

1. **Prefetching**: Links now use `prefetch={true}` to preload routes
2. **Loading States**: Added loading.js for better loading UX
3. **Error Handling**: Added not-found.js for better error UX

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Keep Server Components as the Default**: Only convert to Client Components when necessary (for interactivity)
2. **Move Client Components Down the Tree**: Keep as much of the UI as possible in Server Components
3. **Use the Fetch Cache**: Leverage the built-in caching of fetch in Server Components
4. **Implement Proper Image Optimization**: Always use next/image for images
5. **Optimize Third-Party Scripts**: Use next/script with appropriate loading strategies
6. **Monitor Bundle Size**: Regularly check bundle size and optimize large dependencies

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the performance of the application:

1. Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
2. Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
3. Use the built-in Next.js Analytics if using Vercel
4. Monitor bundle size with `next/bundle-analyzer`
